# NewsScraper-Expanded
Scrape the latest news articles into JSON format using RSS feeds and backup methods.

## Overview

Scrape any news source from RSS feeds or HTML simply by adding their URLs to the included JSON file.

Added so far: extensive logging & error handling, AI integration prep, optimization changes, removal of paywalled content, a focus on crypto news sources and their eventual summarization/preparation. The below README will be reworked for a production repo once additional testing is completed.
